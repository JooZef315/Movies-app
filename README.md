# OMBDApp
## Search and discover all the movies you want, Save the ones you are interested in!

I used **axios** to call [omdb](http://www.omdbapi.com/) API, fetching the the wanted data, saving the user chosen movies in the local storage using **async-storage**
, with options to clean the the storage and visiting IMDB page 
 ##### It is a **React Native** app using expo CLI, I used 
 - hooks 
 - react-navigation 
 - expo fonts  
 - ionicons
